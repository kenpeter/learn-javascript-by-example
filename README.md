## Intro

Inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) and [Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers#why-use-it). 

All I want to do is learning javascript by examples (and hopefully get a relevant job). Some people are very good at building their personal projects. Some people are good at following examples and tutorials. I belong to the 2nd category. Again, all I want to do is to learn some javascript by examples (and hopefully get a relevant job).
